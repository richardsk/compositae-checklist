<h3>Taxonomy</h3>
<p>The taxonomic status of a name (accepted, inferred accepted, synonym or unknown) is derived from the preferred ranking of taxonomic concepts from data providers.  A number of rules check the internal taxonomic logic.  If a name is considered a synonym but the name it points to as accepted has no concept this is deemed ‘inferred accepted’.  If a genus has accepted species in it, but no explicit taxonomic concept has been contributed by any data provider that it is also ‘inferred accepted’.  If a name points to a name that points to another name the first is redirected to the third.</p>
