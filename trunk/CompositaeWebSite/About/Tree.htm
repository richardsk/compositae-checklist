<h3>Tree</h3>
<p>There have been many changes to the higher ranks in the Compositae recently and in the interest of data management and accessibility it was decided to include only the tribal classification in the hierarchy following Kadereit, J.W., Jeffrey, C. (Eds.). 2007. Asterales in Kubitzki, K. (series ed.) The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants. Vol. VIII, Springer: Heidelberg. Subfamilies, supertribes, subtribes, subgenera, subsections and series are included as name entries but are simply listed alphabetically under the family or relevant tribe or genus. This approach has also been taken within genera and for infraspecific taxa.</p>

<p>By default the tree shows names that have a preferred name concept (are currently accepted or a synonym). It is possible to display all names by checking the box “show names with unknown status”.</p>

<p>There are a number of other families displayed in the tree. Many of these families are accepted but as the database concerns the Compositae alone, no preferred concepts for these families are included. They are present due to errors in family assignment of data or the presence of earlier homonyms in a different family.</p>

<p>Under Compositae there are a number of genera that are not assigned to tribe as this information was not available in the data received to date. If you know what tribe any of these genera belong to please send us feedback.</p>
