<h3>Name Search Help</h3>

<p>The <b>simple</b> search returns records that contain the search text anywhere within the full Scientific Name</p>

<b>Simple search tips</b></p>
<p>The search results show the scientific name for a taxon at any rank, including the authors of the names.</p>

<p>For example<br />
“austral” will find names containing “austral” anywhere in the text e.g., australis and australe<br />
“raoulia hoo” will find names containing “raoulia” and “hoo” e.g., Raoulia hookeri Allan or Raoulia australis Hook.f.</p>

<p><b>Advanced Search</b></p>
<p>Advanced search offers numerous options for making searches more precise and getting more useful results. Advanced search can include 'and', 'or' and 'not' statements, although the 'and' search function is performed by default when more than one word is entered in the search field.</p>

<p>For example "raoulia and y" will find names containing both "raoulia" and "y" e.g. Raoulia goyenii Kirk.<br />
"raoulia or australis" will return all terms that contain either "raoulia" or "australis" or both e.g. Bidens australis Spreng. and Raoulia australis Hook.f.<br />
"raoulia not australis" will return all names containing "raoulia" but not containing "australis" e.g. Raoulia monroi Hook.f. but not Raoulia australis Hook.f.<br />
"raoulia and (h or cin) not hook" will return names containing "raoulia" and any names or authors containing "h" or "cin", but not containing "hook" e.g. Raoulia cinerea Petrie and Raoulia hectorii var. mollis Buchanan, but not Raoulia australis Hook.f.<br /></p>

<p>You can also search by individual field name:</p>
<p><b>Full Name:</b> This field contains the scientific name for a taxon at any rank, including the authors of the names, e.g. "<i>Bidens fervida</i>  Lam."</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> The author(s) of the name cited in standard form as listed by Brummitt and Powell (1992: Authors of Plant Names. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.) and the International Plant Names Index).</p>

<p><b>Year:</b> This field contains the year the name was published.</p>

<p><b>Name Reference:</b> This field will search the reference data.  For example "opera botanica" will return all of names with that reference (in that format).</p>

<p><b>Accepted name:</b> This field contains the accepted name.</p>

<p><b>Parent name:</b> This field allows a search for all of the children of a parent.</p>

<p><b>Taxon rank:</b> This field contains the rank for each taxonomic name listed in the database. This field can be used to find all the names at a given rank, for example by searching for "family" all family names will be returned. The most common values in this field are: Family, Genus, species, subspecies (subsp.), variety (var.), forma (f.).</p>

<p><b>Basionym:</b> This field allows a search for all of all names with the text in the basionym.</p>

<p><b>Data provider:</b> This field allows a search for all names that include a record from the chosen data provider.</p>

<p><b>Distribution searches by TDWG Levels:</b> This field allows a search for all records that are recorded in the database as present in the chosen TDWG level.  You can combine a number of regions using the 'and' or 'or' check boxes to search at once.</p>

<p><b>LSID:</b> This field contains the LSID (Life Science IDentifier).</p>

<p>By checking the <b>and</b> or <b>or</b> boxes more search criteria can be added.</p>
